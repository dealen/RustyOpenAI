# Things to implement

#### Text generation
- [Chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api) - kinda done but will need some refactoring and improvements but for now is fine.
- [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview) - is working with every call to open AI (chat completions) but will need some improvements in case of detailed comunication (what was wrong with message to AI)
